\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the model. The left hand side must be a
\link[survival]{Surv} object specifying a right censored survival or
competing risks outcome. The status indicator, normally 0=alive, 1=dead.
Other choices are TRUE/FALSE (TRUE = death) or 1/2 (2=death). For competing
risks, the event variable will be a factor, whose first level is treated as
censoring. The right hand side is the usual linear combination of
covariates. If there are multiple time points, the special term "tve(.)"
can be used to specify that the effect of the variable inside the
parentheses will be time varying. In the output this will be represented
as the interaction between the time points and the variable.}

\item{time}{Numeric vector specifying the times at which the cumulative
incidence or survival probability effect estimates are desired.}

\item{cause}{Numeric or character constant specifying the cause indicator of
interest.}

\item{link}{Link function for the cumulative incidence regression model.}

\item{model.censoring}{Type of model for the censoring distribution. Options
are "stratified", which computes the pseudo-observations stratified on a
set of categorical covariates, "aareg" for Aalen's additive hazards model,
and "coxph" for Cox's proportional hazards model. With those options, we
assume that the time to event and event indicator are conditionally
independent of the censoring time, and that the censoring model is
correctly specified. If "independent", we assume completely independent
censoring, i.e., that the time to event and covariates are independent of
the censoring time. the censoring time is independent of the covariates in
the model. Can also be a custom function, see Details and the "Extending
eventglm" vignette.}

\item{formula.censoring}{A one sided formula (e.g., \code{~ x1 + x2})
specifying the model for the censoring distribution. If NULL, uses the same
mean model as for the outcome. Missing values in any covariates for the
censoring model will cause an error.}

\item{ipcw.method}{Which method to use for calculation of inverse probability
of censoring weighted pseudo observations. "binder" the default, uses the
number of observations as the denominator, while the "hajek" method uses
the sum of the weights as the denominator.}

\item{data}{Data frame in which all variables of formula can be interpreted.}

\item{survival}{Set to TRUE to use survival (one minus the cumulative
incidence) as the outcome. Not available for competing risks models.}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of 'prior weights' to be used in the
fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector found in data.}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be
used in the fitting process.}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data
contain \code{NA}s. The default is set by the \code{na.action} setting of
\link[base]{options}, and is \link[stats]{na.fail} if that is unset. The
'factory-fresh' default is \link[stats]{na.omit}. Another possible value is
NULL, no action. Value \link[stats]{na.exclude} can be useful.}

\item{offset}{this can be used to specify an a priori known component to be
included in the linear predictor during fitting. This should be NULL or a
numeric vector of length equal to the number of cases. One or more
\link[stats]{offset} terms can be included in the formula instead or as
well, and if more than one is specified their sum is used. See
\link[stats]{model.offset}. If length(time) > 1, then any offset terms must
appear in the formula.}

\item{control}{a list of parameters for controlling the fitting process. This
is passed to \link[stats]{glm.control}.}

\item{model}{a logical value indicating whether model frame should be
included as a component of the returned value.}

\item{x}{logical value indicating whether the model matrix used in the
fitting process should be returned as components of the returned value.}

\item{y}{logical value indicating whether the response vector
(pseudo-observations) used in the fitting process should be returned as
components of the returned value.}

\item{singular.ok}{logical; if FALSE a singular fit is an error.}

\item{contrasts}{an optional list. See the contrasts.arg of
\link[stats]{model.matrix.default}.}

\item{id}{An optional integer vector of subject identifiers, found in data.
If this is present, then generalized estimating equations will be used
to fit the model. This can be used, for example, if there are multiple
observations per individual represented as multiple rows in data.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \link[stats]{glm.fit}}
}
\value{
A pseudoglm object, with its own methods for print, summary, and
  vcov. It inherits from glm, so predict and other glm methods are supported.
}
\description{
Using pseudo observations for the cumulative incidence, this function then
runs a generalized linear model and estimates the parameters representing
contrasts in the cumulative incidence at a particular set of times (specified
by the \code{time} argument) across covariate values. The link function can
be "identity" for estimating differences in the cumulative incidence, "log"
for estimating ratios, and any of the other link functions supported by
\link[stats]{quasi}.
}
\details{
The argument "model.censoring" determines how the pseudo
  observations are calculated. This can be the name of a function or the
  function itself, which must have arguments "formula", "time", "cause",
  "data", "type", "formula.censoring", and "ipcw.method". If it is the name
  of a function, this code will look for a function with the prefix "pseudo_"
  first, to avoid clashes with related methods such as coxph. The function
  then must return a vector of pseudo observations, one for each subject in
  data which are used in subsequent calculations. For examples of the
  implementation, see the "pseudo-modules.R" file, or the vignette "Extending
  eventglm".
