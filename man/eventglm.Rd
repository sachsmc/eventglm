\title{Regression Models for Event History Outcomes}
\description{
A user friendly, easy to understand way of doing event history regression
for marginal estimands of interest, including the cumulative incidence and the
restricted mean survival, using the pseudo observation framework for estimation.
The interface uses the well known formulation of a generalized linear model and allows
for features including plotting of residuals, the use of sampling weights, and corrected
variance estimation.
